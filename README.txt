------------HELLO!-------------

My username is doublehowdy and this is an old version of my website, Terre Verte. 

------------PERMISSIONS----------

You can edit as much or as little as you please.
I would apreciate credit if you end up using a good chunk of the code but I'm not gonna hunt you down or say anything if take credit for the code.
If you do decide to credit me, you can link back to my neocities page at https://terreverte.neocities.org/. 

KEEP IN MIND:

I do not own the following assets:

1. metal_texture.png [stole this off of a stock website ages ago]
2. fonts/kode-mono-v2-latin-regular.woff2 [This is a google font taken from the database and stripped of its tracking data. I used Google webfont helper https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts]


------------ACTIVE PAGES----------

I've deleted most of the content but there are a few pages left to showcase its basic functions. Those pages are:

index.html
not_found.html
home.html
about.html
fanart.html
hobbies.html
photos.html

-----------HOW TO USE----------

Duplicate a page that you like and replace things with your own content. 
The "html" folder has pages in it that aren't your main ones ( main ones like 'home' or 'not_found' ).
I recommend keeping this organizing system the same as is, just delete the stuff you dont want.

-----------TROUBLESHOOT----------

Everything is between you and your Gods now. 
Peace and love, but I will not help anyone fix bugs on this layout, there's a reason I made a new one.
