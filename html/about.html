Eerie ruins with backstories to explore? Check. Bisexuality? Check. What more could a man want?</td>

I think also picking a theme and sticking to it helped things feel more cohesive rather than the misc. piles of levels in something like Mario Odyssey (which is still a fun game don't kill me).</td>

But it has an expansive role-playing story line with so many outcomes, and there's just endless ways to play it. I think it's good for players of pretty much any experience level.</td>

But AWL just has a certain charm to it. I like the aesthetics of it better, I like the music better, I like that it has an end goal and that you age alongside your community. I'd like to see another farming game like this one day.</td>
